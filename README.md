# CVE-2017-7494

Remote root exploit for the SAMBA CVE-2017-7494 vulnerability

## Details

This exploit is divided in 2 parts:

 * First, it compiles a payload called "implant.c" and generates a library (libimplantx32.so or libimplantx64.so) that changes to the root user, detaches from the parent processes and spawns a reverse shell.
 * Second, it finds a writeable share in the specified target host, upload the library with a random name and tries to load it.

As long as the target is vulnerable and the payload is the correct for the target operating system and architecture, the exploit is 100% reliable.
